# Real reason

I know the topis is fairly simple. The real reason to create and maintain this repository is not to solve problem but to document whole working process, commiting practices, branching, PR, README files etc.

# Linked List in Python

This is just simplified linked list written entirely in Python.

# Testing

I used `pytest`. All tests are in `testing.py` file. I will also implement automatic testing with every push.

- [ ] Git actions - automatic tests with every push

# MAYBE

I just thought about creating series (multiple repositories) with implementaion of basic (or maybe even more advanced) data structures or sorting alghoritms. Just to show off, let people know that I know those things "from scratch", not only how to use python builtin `sort()` function.
